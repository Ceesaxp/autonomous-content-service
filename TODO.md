## Questions for Product Team

1. What quality thresholds should trigger automatic content revision?
2. Should quality assessment be real-time during content editing or batch after completion?
3. Are there specific industry compliance requirements for content quality documentation?
4. Should we implement quality-based pricing tiers for different service levels?
5. What level of quality assurance transparency should clients have access to?
