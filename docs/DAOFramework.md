 # DAO Governance & Treasury Framework

 ## 1. Token Economics
 - Token supply, distribution schedule, vesting and staking models.
 - Incentive mechanisms for contributors, reviewers, and token holders.

 ## 2. Roles & Permissions
 - Definition of on-chain roles (e.g., token holder, governor, proposer).
 - Quorum thresholds, voting power calculations, and delegation rules.

 ## 3. Proposal & Voting Workflow
 - Off-chain proposal drafting (Snapshot, forums) and on-chain execution paths.
 - Proposal lifecycle: creation, discussion, voting, execution, and veto mechanisms.

 ## 4. Treasury & Multisig Management
 - Smart contract-based multisig wallet for treasury funds (e.g., Gnosis Safe).
 - Automated disbursement triggers based on quality gates or milestone completion.

 ## 5. Oracles & Execution Triggers
 - Integration with oracles for off-chain data (e.g., quality score, milestone metrics).
 - Conditional execution of on-chain functions based on verified inputs.

 ## 6. Blockchain Platform & Gas Strategy
 - Selection of target chain (Ethereum L1, Polygon, Arbitrum, or others).
 - Gas optimization strategies and fallback network arrangements.

 ## 7. Upgradeability & Emergency Controls
 - Timelock and governance module upgrade patterns.
 - Emergency halt mechanisms and contingency plans for vulnerabilities.

 ## 8. Compliance & Audit
 - On-chain transparency, event logs, and audit tools integration.
 - Anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) considerations for token issuance.
