# Step 3.3: Dynamic Pricing Engine

## Prompt

```
Design and implement the dynamic pricing engine with these requirements:
1. Create pricing models for different content types and complexity levels
2. Implement real-time market rate monitoring via APIs
3. Design algorithms for competitive price adjustment
4. Implement client-specific pricing based on volume and history
5. Create surge pricing for expedited delivery
6. Design discount mechanisms for client retention
7. Implement cost calculation for resource utilization (API costs, processing time)
8. Create pricing simulation for forecasting
9. Implement A/B testing for pricing strategies

Output should include implementation code, pricing algorithms, market monitoring mechanisms, and integration guide.
