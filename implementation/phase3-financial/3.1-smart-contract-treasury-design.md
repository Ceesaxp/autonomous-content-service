# Step 3.1: Smart Contract Treasury Design

## Prompt

```
Design the smart contract treasury system with these requirements:
1. Create smart contracts for secure fund management on Ethereum and/or Polygon
2. Implement multi-signature security for high-value transactions
3. Design automated payment distribution system for service costs
4. Implement revenue allocation logic (operations, reserves, upgrades)
5. Create financial reporting mechanisms that comply with basic accounting principles
6. Design audit trail for all financial transactions
7. Implement automatic rebalancing between crypto and stable assets
8. Create upgrade path for contract modifications
9. Include emergency fund recovery mechanisms

Output should include smart contract code (Solidity), deployment scripts, security analysis, and operational guide.
```
