## Technology Stack

 - Think hard before implementing any step.
 - Do not use React, Angular, Vue or any other JavaScript frameworks. Keep your JavaScript to vanilla JS ES6.
 - Where reasonable -- consider using HTMX for server-side rendering.
 - Always test your work with `go vet` and `golangci-lint run` before committing.
