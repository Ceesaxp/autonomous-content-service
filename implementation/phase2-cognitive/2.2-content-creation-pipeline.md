# Step 2.2: Content Creation Pipeline

## Prompt

```
Implement the core content creation pipeline with these requirements:
1. Design a modular pipeline with these stages: research, outlining, drafting, editing, finalization
2. Implement research module that can gather information from specified sources
3. Create an outlining system that structures content based on topic and format
4. Build a drafting system that generates content following the outline
5. Implement an editing system that can improve content quality
6. Create a finalization system that formats content according to delivery specifications
7. Implement progress tracking and status reporting
8. Include error handling and recovery mechanisms for each stage
9. Design pipeline configuration options for different content types

Output should include implementation code for each pipeline stage, configuration schema, and integration tests.
```
