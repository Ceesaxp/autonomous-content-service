# Step 2.3: Self-Review and Quality Assurance System

## Prompt

```
Design and implement the self-review quality assurance system with these requirements:
1. Create evaluation criteria for different content types (readability, accuracy, engagement, etc.)
2. Implement a multi-pass review system with specialized focus at each stage
3. Design a scoring mechanism to quantify content quality
4. Implement fact-checking capabilities against reliable sources
5. Create a plagiarism detection mechanism
6. Implement style consistency checking
7. Design improvement suggestion generation for low-scoring content
8. Create a revision tracking system to measure quality improvement
9. Implement benchmark comparison against industry standards

Output should include implementation code, evaluation algorithms, benchmark datasets, and integration guide.
```
