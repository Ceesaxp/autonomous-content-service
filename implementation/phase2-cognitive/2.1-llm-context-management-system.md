# Step 2.1: LLM Context Management System

## Prompt

```
Design and implement the context management system for the LLM orchestration layer with these requirements:
1. Create a system for maintaining conversation context across multiple interactions
2. Implement a priority-based context window management system with memory retention rules
3. Design prompt templates for different content creation scenarios (blog posts, social media, technical writing)
4. Implement a context injection system for domain-specific knowledge
5. Create a context switching mechanism for handling multiple projects
6. Design a serialization format for storing and retrieving context
7. Implement mechanisms to prevent context collapse during extended operations
8. Include metrics collection for context usage optimization

Output should include implementation code, context management algorithm explanation, and integration guide with the cognitive engine.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Context Management Architecture

#### Context Structure
- Define hierarchical context structure
- Implement priority-based context retention
- Design efficient context serialization format

#### Memory Management
- Implement short-term and long-term memory systems
- Design context windowing for managing token limitations
- Create relevance scoring for context prioritization

#### Prompt Engineering
- Design modular prompt templates for different content types
- Implement dynamic prompt composition
- Create context-aware instruction formatting

#### Domain Knowledge Integration
- Design knowledge injection mechanisms
- Implement retrieval-augmented generation
- Create domain-specific context enhancement

#### Context Switching
- Implement project context isolation
- Design efficient context loading/unloading
- Create context version control for rollback capability

#### Performance and Monitoring
- Implement context usage metrics
- Design optimization algorithms for context efficiency
- Create monitoring and alerting for context-related issues
