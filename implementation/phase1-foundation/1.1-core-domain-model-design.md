# Step 1.1: Core Domain Model Design

## Prompt

```
Design the complete domain model for an autonomous content creation service with the following requirements:
1. Entities must include: Client, Project, Content, Transaction, Feedback, and System capability
2. Define all attributes for each entity with proper data types
3. Map relationships between entities with cardinality
4. Define bounded contexts for separation of concerns
5. Include domain events that will trigger system actions
6. Design must be implementation-agnostic at this stage
7. Include validation rules for each entity

Create a comprehensive domain model diagram and accompanying documentation explaining the reasoning behind design decisions. The output should be implementation-ready for Phase 1.2.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Entities and Their Attributes

#### Client Entity
- Unique identifier
- Contact information
- Billing details
- Service preferences
- Authentication credentials
- Contract information

#### Project Entity
- Unique identifier
- Project type/category
- Timeline and deadlines
- Status and progress tracking
- Requirements and specifications
- Budget and resource allocation

#### Content Entity
- Unique identifier
- Content type
- Creation and modification timestamps
- Content data (text, metadata)
- Version control information
- Status (draft, review, published)

#### Transaction Entity
- Unique identifier
- Transaction type
- Amount and currency
- Timestamp
- Status
- Reference to related entities

#### Feedback Entity
- Unique identifier
- Feedback type
- Rating/score
- Detailed comments
- Timestamp
- Source (client, self-review, etc.)

#### System Capability Entity
- Unique identifier
- Capability type
- Status (active, learning, deprecated)
- Performance metrics
- Resource requirements
- Dependencies

### Relationships

Define clear relationships between all entities with proper cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

### Domain Events

Identify key domain events that will trigger system actions, such as:
- ProjectCreated
- ContentRequested
- ContentDelivered
- PaymentReceived
- FeedbackSubmitted
- CapabilityUpgraded

### Validation Rules

Establish validation rules for each entity to ensure data integrity and business rule enforcement.
