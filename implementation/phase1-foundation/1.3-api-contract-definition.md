# Step 1.3: API Contract Definition

## Prompt

```
Design the complete API contract for both internal and external services with these requirements:
1. Define all endpoints needed for client interaction
2. Define all endpoints needed for content creation pipeline
3. Define all endpoints needed for financial operations
4. Use OpenAPI 3.0 specification format
5. Include detailed request/response schemas with examples
6. Define error codes and response formats
7. Include rate limiting and security considerations
8. Design webhook interfaces for event notifications
9. Document authentication and authorization requirements

Output should include complete OpenAPI specification file and authentication implementation guide.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### API Design Principles

#### Client-facing APIs
- Create intuitive and RESTful endpoints for client interactions
- Implement proper resource naming conventions
- Design consistent response formats and error handling

#### Internal Service APIs
- Design modular service interfaces for system components
- Implement efficient data exchange formats
- Ensure proper service discovery and versioning

#### Financial APIs
- Design secure endpoints for financial operations
- Implement idempotency for payment processing
- Ensure compliance with financial regulations

#### Security and Performance
- Design authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Implement rate limiting and quota enforcement
- Ensure proper input validation and sanitization

#### Events and Webhooks
- Design event-driven architecture for notifications
- Implement webhook registration and delivery
- Ensure event reliability and ordering

#### Documentation
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Include clear usage examples
- Document security and compliance requirements
