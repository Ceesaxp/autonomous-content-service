# Step 1.2: Data Schema Design

## Prompt

```
Using the domain model from Step 1.1, design a complete database schema with the following requirements:
1. Design tables and relationships for a PostgreSQL implementation
2. Include all necessary indexes for performance optimization
3. Define appropriate constraints (PK, FK, unique constraints, etc.)
4. Include timestamp fields for auditing/tracking
5. Design with data partitioning considerations for scalability
6. Include JSON fields where appropriate for flexible attribute storage
7. Design versioning strategy for schema evolution
8. Include detailed SQL creation scripts with comments

Output should include ER diagram, SQL creation scripts, and implementation notes on indexing strategy.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Database Schema Considerations

#### Table Design Principles
- Create normalized table structures for core entities
- Use appropriate data types to minimize storage and optimize querying
- Implement proper constraints and indexes for data integrity and performance

#### PostgreSQL-specific Features
- Utilize JSON/JSONB columns for flexible attribute storage
- Implement table partitioning for high-volume tables
- Use PostgreSQL-specific indexing strategies where appropriate

#### Performance Optimization
- Develop indexing strategy based on access patterns
- Consider read vs. write optimization based on entity usage
- Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data

#### Auditing and Versioning
- Include created_at and updated_at timestamps for all records
- Develop versioning strategy for content and other mutable entities
- Implement audit logging for critical operations

#### Security Considerations
- Design with data privacy and security in mind
- Implement column-level encryption where needed
- Consider data retention policies
