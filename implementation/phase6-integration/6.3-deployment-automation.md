# Step 6.3: Deployment Automation

## Prompt

```
Implement the deployment automation system with these requirements:
1. Create infrastructure as code for all environment components
2. Implement CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment
3. Design environment promotion workflow (dev, staging, production)
4. Implement feature flagging for controlled rollout
5. Create automatic rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
6. Design database migration automation
7. Implement configuration validation before deployment
8. Create deployment verification testing
9. Design scaling policies for production environment

Output should include implementation code, pipeline configurations, deployment scripts, and operational procedures.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Deployment Automation Architecture

#### Infrastructure as Code
- Implement Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Design modular infrastructure components
- Create environment templating system
- Implement infrastructure versioning

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- Design continuous integration workflow
- Implement automated testing and quality gates
- Create deployment pipeline stages
- Design approval and promotion processes

#### Release Management
- Implement feature flag management
- Design progressive rollout strategies
- Create version control and tagging
- Implement release notes generation

#### Database Management
- Design automated schema migrations
- Implement data consistency validation
- Create backup and rollback procedures
- Design zero-downtime database updates

#### Deployment Safety
- Implement pre-deployment validation
- Design canary testing for releases
- Create automatic rollback triggers
- Implement post-deployment verification

#### Environment Management
- Design environment promotion workflow
- Implement configuration management
- Create environment-specific settings
- Design production scaling policies
