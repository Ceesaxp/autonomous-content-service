# Step 6.1: Service Orchestration

## Prompt

```
Design and implement the service orchestration layer with these requirements:
1. Create a microservice architecture using containerization
2. Implement service discovery and registration
3. Design event-driven communication between components
4. Implement circuit breakers for failure isolation
5. Create automatic scaling based on demand
6. Design blue/green deployment for zero-downtime updates
7. Implement centralized logging and monitoring
8. Create alerting and self-healing mechanisms
9. Design configuration management and distribution

Output should include implementation code, infrastructure as code scripts, orchestration diagrams, and operational guides.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Orchestration Architecture

#### Microservice Design
- Implement containerization with Docker
- Design service boundaries and responsibilities
- Create infrastructure as code with Terraform
- Implement Kubernetes for orchestration

#### Service Communication
- Design API gateway implementation
- Implement service mesh for communication
- Create event-driven architecture with message queues
- Design asynchronous processing patterns

#### Reliability Engineering
- Implement circuit breakers and retries
- Design bulkhead patterns for isolation
- Create graceful degradation mechanisms
- Implement fault tolerance strategies

#### Scalability and Performance
- Design horizontal and vertical scaling
- Implement auto-scaling based on metrics
- Create load balancing and distribution
- Design caching strategies for performance

#### Observability
- Implement centralized logging system
- Design comprehensive monitoring
- Create alerting and notification system
- Implement distributed tracing

#### Deployment Strategies
- Design blue/green deployment pipeline
- Implement canary releases
- Create rollback mechanisms
- Design feature flag infrastructure
