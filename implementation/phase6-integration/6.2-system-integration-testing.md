# Step 6.2: System Integration Testing

## Prompt

```
Design and implement comprehensive integration testing with these requirements:
1. Create end-to-end test scenarios for complete business processes
2. Implement performance testing under various load conditions
3. Design security penetration testing
4. Implement chaos engineering tests for resilience
5. Create data consistency verification across services
6. Design API contract testing between components
7. Implement user experience simulation testing
8. Create financial transaction integrity testing
9. Design long-running stability tests

Output should include test implementation code, test scenarios, performance benchmarks, and reporting mechanisms.
```
