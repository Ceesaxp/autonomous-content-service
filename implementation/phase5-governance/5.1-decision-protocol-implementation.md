# Step 5.1: Decision Protocol Implementation

## Prompt

```
Design and implement the decision protocols with these requirements:
1. Create a rule-based system for content policy enforcement
2. Implement ethical guidelines verification for generated content
3. Design decision trees for common operational scenarios
4. Implement logging and justification for all significant decisions
5. Create override thresholds for exceptional situations
6. Design conflict resolution mechanisms for competing priorities
7. Implement stakeholder impact analysis for major decisions
8. Create feedback loops for decision quality improvement
9. Design emergency shutdown protocols for critical failures

Output should include implementation code, decision framework documentation, rule sets, and operational guides.
```
