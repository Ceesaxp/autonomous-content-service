# Step 5.5: DAO-style Governance & Treasury

## Prompt

```
Design and implement the DAO-style governance and treasury system with these requirements:
1. Define token economics: supply, distribution, vesting, and staking
2. Design on-chain/off-chain proposal and voting workflows
3. Implement multisig treasury control and fund allocation
4. Create oracle-based triggers for governance-driven actions
5. Design quorum rules, voting periods, and threshold parameters
6. Implement upgrade timelocks and emergency halt mechanisms
7. Create membership roles and permission models
8. Design transparency dashboards and audit logs
9. Integrate governance with existing decision protocols

Output should include smart contract specifications, governance workflow documentation, treasury integration code, and execution guides.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### DAO Governance Architecture

- Implement on-chain voting contract integration
- Create vote tallying and result publication
- Implement vote delegation and off-ramping

#### Treasury & Multisig Management
- Implement multisig wallet integration
- Design fund disbursement and budgeting flows
- Create treasury dashboard and analytics
- Implement treasury emergency withdrawal protocols

#### Oracle & Trigger Integration
- Design governance-triggered oracle events
- Implement oracle contract adapters
- Create automated post-vote execution triggers
- Implement off-chain to on-chain event bridges

#### Permissions & Role Management
- Define DAO member roles and capabilities
- Implement access control lists in smart contracts
- Create dynamic permission adjustment workflows
